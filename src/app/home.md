# 👋🏽 Hey there!

My name is **Bibek Ghimire**. I'm a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
I'm currently working on [internal docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/portland/2024/sociological-considerations-in-designing-an-internal-documentation-platform-alistair-gray/) and AI tools at [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

## 🗒️ LISTS

I'm a curator at heart. For the longest time, these lists sat hidden in my Notion–I figured I might as well share them here.
