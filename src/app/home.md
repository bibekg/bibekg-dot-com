# 👋🏽 Hey there!

My name is **Bibek Ghimire**. I'm a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area and a proud UCLA alum.
I'm currently working on [internal docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/portland/2024/sociological-considerations-in-designing-an-internal-documentation-platform-alistair-gray/) and AI tools at [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

## 🪴 Projects

{% resource title="Pinpoint" url="https://playpinpoint.app" %}
I made this daily guessing game for places in your city (SF, NYC, LA, Philly). I also wrote [this blog post](https://imperfectionist.substack.com/p/how-i-built-pinpoint) about all the fun design challenges that it involved.

## 🗒️ LISTS

I'm a curator at heart. For the longest time, these lists sat hidden in my Notion–I figured I might as well share them here.
