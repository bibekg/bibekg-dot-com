## 📱 Apps

{% resource title="Readwise" url="https://readwise.io" %}
A suite of tools for reading books and articles more effectively. I use them to take notes on articles and Kindle e-books I read, then sync them to my Notion to (1) keep track of what I've been reading and (2) make it easier to reference my notes later for when I want to write about them.

{% resource title="Things3" url="https://culturedcode.com/things/" %}
A minimalist task management app built with the [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) methodology that's been a staple of my productivity workflow for years. I don't always follow GTD perfectly but it's worked pretty well for me since 2021 or so. The app itself is gorgeous and beautifully designed.

{% resource title="BeReal" url="https://bereal.com" %}
BeReal is one of the few social media apps that strikes the rare balance of helping me feel close to friends without hijacking my attention. [I love it so much I even wrote a blog post about it.](https://emlog.substack.com/p/bereal)

{% resource title="Strava" url="https://strava.com" %}
The social media for type 2 fun like cycling and running. I'm a sucker for any app that stitches together powerful incentive systems (like social sharing & competition) with healthy behaviors (like fitness). Been using it for years so it's also really fun (especially for bike rides) to see my adventures stack up on the heat map.

## Product features

{% resource title="Live Photos" url="https://support.apple.com/en-us/104966" %}
They basically invented the animated pictures they have in Harry Potter and people are out here disabling it to save storage, smh. They also make for such a great way to capture the full depth of moments and stitch them into a video afterwards.
