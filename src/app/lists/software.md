## ðŸ“± Apps

{% resource title="BeReal" url="https://bereal.com" %}
BeReal is one of the few social media apps that strikes the rare balance of helping me feel close to friends without hijacking my attention. [I love it so much I even wrote a blog post about it.](https://emlog.substack.com/p/bereal)

{% resource title="Strava" url="https://strava.com" %}
The social media for type 2 fun like cycling and running. I'm a sucker for any app that stitches together powerful incentive systems (like social sharing & competition) with healthy behaviors (like fitness). Been using it for years so it's also really fun (especially for bike rides) to see my adventures stack up on the heat map.

{% resource title="Things3" url="https://culturedcode.com/things/" %}
A minimalist task management app built with the [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) methodology that's been a staple of my productivity workflow for years. I don't always follow GTD perfectly but it's worked pretty well for me since 2021 or so. The app itself is gorgeous and beautifully designed.

{% resource title="How We Feel" url="https://howwefeel.org" %}
A emotions-driven journaling app with fantastic UX, thoughtful social features, and a tasteful LLM integration. I've only recently started using it but it immediately stood out to me as a wonderfully thoughtfully designed app.

In their words:
> How We Feel is a free journal for your well-being created by scientists, designers, engineers, and psychologists. Over time, you will learn precise words to describe how you feel, spot trends and patterns, and practice simple strategies to regulate your emotions in healthy ways.

## Product features

{% resource title="Live Photos" url="https://support.apple.com/en-us/104966" %}
They basically invented the animated pictures they have in Harry Potter and people are out here disabling it to save storage, smh. They also make for such a great way to capture the full depth of moments and stitch them into a video afterwards.
