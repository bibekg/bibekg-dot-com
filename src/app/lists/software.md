In their words:

{% resource title="Things3" url="https://culturedcode.com/things/" %}
A minimalist task management app built with the [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) methodology that's been a staple of my productivity workflow for years. I don't always follow GTD perfectly but it's worked pretty well for me since 2021 or so. The app itself is gorgeous and beautifully designed.

## Product features

{% resource title="Live Photos" %}
They basically invented the animated pictures they have in Harry Potter and people are out here disabling it to save storage, smh. They also make for such a great way to capture the full depth of moments and stitch them into a video afterwards.
