{% resource title="Tristan Harris" url="https://www.humanetech.com/" %}
One of the co-founders of the Center for Humane Technology: a non-profit that works to make technology more humane. He was one of the first prominent figures in the tech industry to call out attention-hacking design and advocate for humane technology. CHT's ethos forms a big part of my own moral compass in how I think about technology and my career.

YouTuber that makes science cool and exciting for kids; super inspirational and the content is really interesting to watch as an adult too. Can't wait to watch his videos and kits with my kids in the future.
