{% resource title="Dictation, e.g. Wispr Flow" url="https://wisprflow.ai/" %}
This is one of those areas where a UX getting slightly more polished makes it categorically more useful. It accurately picking up what I say regardless of how well I enunciate creates a level of trust that fundamentally changes my relationship to computers by getting them more "out of the way" so to speak (pun intended). Reflected on this a bit [here](https://emlog.substack.com/p/a-fully-ai-voice-dictated-emlog).

{% resource title="Writing subtitles for blog posts" %}
I already wrote the whole post, why should I have to write the subtitles too? ... Jokes aside, it's one of the few scenarios where the content I'm feeding the LLM is ~exactly the context it needs for the output I want. I also just find this a fun way to get the creative juices flowing for that fun final step of publishing something.
